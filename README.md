# color-clipmarks-v0.2

A simple and easy to use tool to help you manage and preview your color codes.

## About

I have a habit of saving color codes... a lot of them! Colors that I use often, branding colors that I may need to reference at some point, and colors that I would like to use in a future project.

Over time, these really start to add up and become difficult to manage, organize, and use in a productive manner. I wanted a simple and easy to use tool that I could quickly access on any device, without having to rely on internet access and the overhead cost of premium tools. So, I decided to build this tool.

It's a work in progress, with much more to do in the future, but it's functional. Let me know what you think!

## How To Use

Paste a list of color codes in the textarea at the bottom of the page and click submit.

This will create a clickable box preview for each color provided and display them in a single grid.

You can view the color code for each element by clicking the box preview.

The color code will be displayed in the text box at the top of the page.
